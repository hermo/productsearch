Product search demo application
===============================

Requirements
------------
- modern browser
- working internet connection
- a local web server or a browser which will agree to load things with XHR
  locally

TODO
----

Explore the code and implement the following:

- Finish the implementation for search result stats, SearchStatsView.js
- Add the possibility filter products by their description to.
  This involves adding the relevant element to the UI and implementing the method in
  ProductRepository.js and some glue code to make it run.
- Document the code you change/write. Use ProductRepository as a style reference.

The app is not properly documented, only ProductRepository has sufficient documentation.
